        <p>Hello! My name is Keanu. I am currently studying Cybersecurity and I really enjoy learning new coding skills. I'm excited to build websites and work on fun projects in this class. I hope to learn the basic skills of being a web developer.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy practicing the piano and hiking. I believe practice is the best way to improve so I try to write code whenever I can. I also follow Cybersecurity news to keep up to date with it.</p>

        <p>I have a homelab that I have been maintaining since 2019. It has helped me learn alot about Cybersecurity and coding.</p>
